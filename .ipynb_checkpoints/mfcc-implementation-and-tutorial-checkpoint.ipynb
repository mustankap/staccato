    "# MFCC theory and implementation\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents (MFCCs) is a way of extracting features from an audio. The MFCC uses the MEL scale to divide the frequency band to sub-bands and then extracts the Cepstral Coefficents using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). MEL scale is based on the way humans distinguish between frequencies which makes it very convenient to process sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets first understand how humans perceive sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Human voice sound perception\n",
    "Adult humans fundamental voice frequency range is between 85Hz to 255Hz (85Hz to 180Hz for male and 165Hz to 255Hz for female). On top of the fundamental frequency there are harmonics of fundamental frequencys. Harmonics are whole multiplications of the fundamental frequency. If for instance the fundamental frequency is 100Hz then its second harmonic will be 200Hz, third harmonic is 300Hz and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example in the image below [1] which shows frequency vs. time of several pronounced words and color represents frequency power at that point (yellow strongest and black weakest):\n",
    "<img src=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/media/sound/speechsep-audio/speechsep-2-spect.png\", width=600, height=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the first horizontal yellow line on the bottom of each segment. That is the fundamental frequency and its the strongest. Above that there are harmonics with the same frequncy distance from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans can hear roughly between 20Hz to 20KHz. The perception of sound is non-linear [2] and you can better distinguish between low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds e.g. humans can clearly hear the difference betwee 100Hz and 200Hz but not between 15kHz and 15.1kHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try in usin a tone generator: http://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/\n",
    "\n",
    "## MEL scale\n",
    "A MEL scale is a unit of PITCH proposed by Stevens, Volkmann and Newmann in 1937. The MEL scale is a scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance one from another [3] [4]. Because of how humans perceive sound the MEL scale is a non-lenear scale and the distances between the pitches increeses with frequency.\n",

If there is a signal in the second Nyquist zone (lets say 22.1kHz) it will alias to the first Nyquist zone (22kHz in our case). We dont want this to happend so we add a low pass filter (LPF). All LPFs has a pass-band, stop-band and transition band. \n",

    "The MFCC is a good algorithm to extract high frequency and low frequency information. There are many parts that can be changed depending on the application. One thing that we might want to check is how the power is scattered across frequency band and choosing the filter amount based on that.\n",
